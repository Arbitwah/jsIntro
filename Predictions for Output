let a = 2;

a -= 1;

a++;

let b = 8;

b += 2;

const c = a + b * b;

const d = a * b + b;

const e = a * (b + b);

const f = a * b / a;

const g = b / a * a;

console.log(a, b, c, d, e, f, g);

a will = 2      the reason is because line 5 sets a back to being 2

b will = 10     the reason is becaue line 9 adds two to b

c will = 102    multiplication happens first then the addition

d will = 30     multiplication happens first then addition

e will = 40     Parentheses happens before the multiplication

f will = 10     multiplication happens first then division

g will = 10     division happens first the multiplication

outputs c - g following the rules of operations this is what the outputs should be.
