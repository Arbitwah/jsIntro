Observe the following program and try to predict the final values of its variables.

let a = 2;

a -= 1;

a++;

let b = 8;

b += 2;

const c = a + b * b;

const d = a * b + b;

const e = a * (b + b);

const f = a * b / a;

const g = b / a * a;

console.log(a, b, c, d, e, f, g);

 

From Celsius to Fahrenheit degrees

Write a program that assigns to a variable a temperature in Celsius degrees, then displays it in Fahrenheit degrees.

The conversion between scales is given by the formula: [°F] = [°C] x 9/5 + 32.

 

Multiplication Table

Write a program that assigns a number to a variable. Then write a multiplication table for that number.

FizzBuzz
Write a program that shows all numbers between 1 and 100 with the following exceptions:

It shows "Fizz" instead if the number is divisible by 3.
It shows "Buzz" instead if the number is divisible by 5 and not by 3.
When it's done, improve it so that the program shows "FizzBuzz" instead for numbers divisible both by 3 and by 5.
